# Imperative Programming (COS132)

Depending on how you look at it, this was our very first programming module. In retrospect, I was horrifically disorganized and have lost the specifications for most of these assignments. I can now only surmise their contexts based on the contents of what was submitted.

I have only added the assignments for which I received full or close-to-full marks.
